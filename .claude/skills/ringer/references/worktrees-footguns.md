## Worktrees-mode footguns (learned the hard way)

Run-level `"worktrees": true` gives each task an isolated git worktree of
`repo`, detached at HEAD. Three consequences:

1. **Passing tasks get their worktree DELETED.** Deliverables must land
   outside the task worktree, or the check must export them first.
2. **Worker commits die with the worktree.** Pattern that works: the worker
   leaves changes uncommitted; the check runs
   `git add -A && git diff --cached > <path-outside-worktree>.patch` and
   validates the patch. You apply and commit on your branch after review.
3. **Logs survive** (they go to `<workdir>/logs/`), so post-mortems work
   even on deleted worktrees.
4. **Gitignored outputs silently vanish from patch exports.** `git add -A`
   cannot stage ignored files (build dirs like `dist/`), so a worker's edits
   there pass its checks, export an incomplete patch, and die with the
   worktree. If a task touches any gitignored path, the check must `cp`
   those files to a path outside the worktree explicitly — verify the patch
   AND the copies before trusting the run.

And on your own side of the fence: when integrating patches into the real
repo, stage specific paths — never `git add -A` in a checkout that may hold
someone's untracked scratch files.
