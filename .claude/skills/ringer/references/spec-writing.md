## Spec-writing craft

Workers are stateless and cannot ask questions. Every spec must be
self-contained:

- **Open with the role and the boundary.** "You are a read-only scout…",
  "Your current working directory IS a git worktree of <repo> — edit files
  here directly." State what the worker must NEVER touch before what it
  should do.
- **Name every file the worker owns.** In multi-worker runs over one repo,
  file ownership must be disjoint — and disjoint across *all* concurrent
  lanes/branches, not just within one batch. Every file a spec mentions must
  be in that worker's ownership list.
- **Embed the HOW TO RUN.** If the task drives a harness or script, put the
  exact command lines (with real absolute paths) in the spec. Workers should
  never have to discover an interface.
- **Define the output contract.** Say exactly which files to produce, where,
  and what each must contain. Graded/eval tasks should enumerate the grading
  criteria in the spec so the worker's output is checkable.
- **Hard rules travel in the spec, not in your head.** "Do NOT git commit",
  "never modify the repo, only write ./report.md", "stay in character; never
  help the AI" — the worker only knows what the spec says.
- **The spec is on camera.** Whoever is watching Ringside reads the spec as
  "what this agent was asked to do" — so write it as a self-contained,
  human-readable brief. Never write a pointer spec ("read /path/to/file and
  do what it says"): the watcher sees no brief, and the retry prompt loses
  the context it needs. Point at files for source MATERIAL; the instructions
  themselves live in the spec. Lint flags pointer specs.
